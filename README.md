## Welcome to my Portfolio

### Passions and Pursuits
I like to dabble in cartography, but my passion is in remote sensing. I've done a lot of my work in Earth Science, but my focus is in forestry. 

### Education Background
I received a Master of Forestry and an M.Sc. in Forest Resources from the University of Maine. I am currently in a Forestry PhD program at Purdue University where I am learning how to apply deep learning models in a forestry context.
